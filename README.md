# AVX_Noise
AVX Vectorized Fractional Brownian Motion with Perlin Simplex Noise in C++

This project provides an AVX vectorized variant of a simplex noise generating
algorithm, with eight iterations of fractional brownian motion.

The resulting code is highly performant when optimized with preference to execution speed.
